<div style="text-align: justify"> For this project, I won the Tox21 Student Award at 2019 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Cellular and Computational Toxicoloty. I focus on the Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells, a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line that is commonly used for in vitro cancer research, with over 33,000 publications in PubMed. I explore the key similarities and differences in gene expression networks of MCF-7 cell lines and human breast cancer tissues. The MCF-7 dataset includes 1032 samples obtained from ARCHS4, and the human breast cancer tissue dataset came from the Cancer Genome Atlas, including 1098 breast tissue samples from individuals with breast invasive carcinoma. I used Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA)—a method that takes advantages of correlation amongst genes and graph theory—to explore similarities and differences in key transcription factors, signaling mechanisms and pathways in MCF-7 cell line and human breast cancer tissues. Since cancer cell lines are commonly used in both basic and translational research to understand biological mechanisms, drug effects, and toxicology pathways, our comparison of the regulatory networks of MCF-7 and breast cancer tissues can address some concerns over the validity of using cancer cell lines as standard models for humans. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> I analyzed cancer RNA-seq data from public databases of over 20,000 genes and 8,000 patients to have better insights into cancer research landscape. I found that a substantial number of genes implicated in cancer are relatively poorly studied and will likely be missed by any data analysis pipeline. In addition, there is no indication that the amount of research - indicated by number of publications - is correlated to any objective metric of gene significance. </div>
