<div style="text-align: justify"> Cancer cell lines are commonly used in both basic and translational research to understand biological mechanisms, drug effects, and toxicology pathways. I evaluated the relevance of the Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells, a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, as a model for human breast cancer. For this project, I won the Tox21 Student Award at 2019 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Cellular and Computational Toxicoloty.   </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> I analyzed cancer RNA-seq data from public databases of over 20,000 genes and 8,000 patients to have better insights into cancer research landscape. I found that a substantial number of genes implicated in cancer are relatively poorly studied and will likely be missed by any data analysis pipeline. In addition, there is no indication that the amount of research - indicated by number of publications - is correlated to any objective metric of gene significance. </div>
